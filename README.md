# INSIGHTS INSTALLER

This is a simple repository to automate the installation of the Insights CLI.

Eventually this may be just condensed into one of the Insights repositories,
or serve as a template for an RPM build script.

# To use:

Once you've checked this repository out, simply run the 'install.sh' script
with the name of the directory you want to put Insights into.  E.g.:

sh install.sh $HOME/insights
